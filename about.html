                <p>Hi, I'm Amo, also known as Amo101. I'm a low-poly 3D "artist" who likes making characters and minecraft models in my free time.</p>
                <p>I make all of my models in blockbench but I like to render them in blender if I can</p>
                <p>When I'm not making models I'm probably at school or doing some other project</p>
                <p>This website's html and some CSS was made using chatGPT's website generator GPT since I am terrible at coding HTML</p>
                <p>Also got some help from a friend with a few issues in the website<p>
                <p>If you want me to make you a model submit it <a href="requests.html">Here</a>, ill try to email you asap.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    </div>
    <footer>
        <p>All models made by Amo, free to use.</p>
